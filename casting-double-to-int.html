                    If we go back in time, you were hypothetically creating a super awesome game. I had so generously helped you write your attack() method and you were very appreciative. You're welcome. Anyway, I wanted to talk about something that was in the attack() method that may not have made sense to you at the moment. I want to clear this up. Do you remember seeing...<br/>
                    <br/>
                    <img class="inline-post-image" src="img/castDtoI1.PNG"><br/>
                    <br/>
                    That, my friend is called casting. The reason we have to do this in the attack() method is because Math.random() returns a <strong>double</strong>. However, the variable '<strong>damage</strong>' is an <strong>int</strong>. In order to store the value in damage, we cast (Math.random() * ((max - min) + 1)) into an int by placing (int) before it. What this does, pretty much, is just remove the fractional part of the double. No it doesn not round it up. If the double is 14.99999999999, casting it to an int will make it 14. <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <strong>WARNING:</strong>This cannot be done with a Double. Notice the capital 'D'. Although, Double does have a .intValue() method... but that's for a different post. Now get out there and start casting, you int mage.<br/>
