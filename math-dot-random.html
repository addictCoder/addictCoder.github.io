                    Let's assume you're making a game and in that game, you've created many weapons for the player to use. Each weapon 
                    has a minimum and maximum damage value. Lets say it's the "Holy Club of Stupidity" with a +5 to rock throwing skill(HCoS).
                    The HCoS has a minimum damage value of 5 and a maximum damage value of 20. How would we determine the amount of damage inflicted to an enemy character? Well, in case you didn't read the title of this post, Math.random().<br/>
                    <br/>
                    What is Math.random()? First, divide it at the 'dot' operator into Math and .random(). Let's take a look at Math.
                    Math is a class that is declared final. "public final class Math" This means Math is a class that cannot be subclassed.
                    The other side, .random(), is a static method. Meaning this method cannot be overridden nor does the class need to be instantiated to call the method. So none of the "Math m = new Math();  m.random();". So what does all this do and how will
                    this be good for the weapons of your awesome game?<br/>
                    <br/>
                    The .random() method returns a double between 0.0(inclusive) and 1.0(exclusive). However, this doesn't cover the full range of weapons min and max damage values. So we need to create a formula to generate the random damage value between the min and max values. It will look something like this:<br/>
                    <br/>

                    <br/>
                    So what did we do here? We take the min value of 5 and added (Math.random() * 16) to it. Being that .random() returns a value of 0.0 through 1.0(exclusive), then multiplied by 16, we get a random number between 0.0 and 15.99. We want to cast that value to an int by putting (int) before the (Math.random() * 16). This takes the random value and removes the fractional part of the double. So now we have a whole number between 0 and 15. Finally adding 5 to this value leaves us with a random number between 5 and 20.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Getting back to the awesome game you're hypothetically making. We are going to want to execute that line of code in a method, most likely a method called attack(). The only problem is, no matter what weapon is equiped, the attack() will only return a value between 5 and 20. What if we find The Haircomb of Ultimate Doom and its damage is between 50 and 200!? We'll have to make a quick modification to the attack() that we haven't coded yet. The best way to return a random number between any given minimum value and maximum value, will look something like this:<br/>
                    <br/>

                    <br/>
                    I hope this helps you understand Math.random() a little bit more.
