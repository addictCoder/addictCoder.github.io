                <h1>Who the f*** is addictCoder?</h1>
                <p>
                    Well, no one too important. Just a dude who has spent most of his adult life as a hobbyist "programmer." Attempting to program video games, websites, and apps to no avail. None the less, he continued his relentless attempts, learning more as he went along. Spent countless hours watching tutorials, reading scripting documentation, programming small number games, and modifying other scripts found on the internet. "Drag and drop" programming using stencyl was just another chapter in his journey to learn programming. Then a friend made a great suggestion...<br/>
                    <br/>
                    addictCoder was on a mission to learn Java. Why not? It's sitting in the number one spot of the TOIBE Index. There are great certifications and career opportunities that come with it. However, he still felt empty. Deep down, he knew the only thing he wanted to do in life was program video games. And all he had ever heard about video game programming was C++, C++, and C++.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    The addictCoder stuck to his plan day after day, week after week. Creating endless java console applications and starting to read the java syntax as if it were his first language. This really started to motivate him which then made him want to start experiementing with other things in Java. During a little internet search he saw something familiar, but strange.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    public static void Main(string[] args)<br/>
                    <br/>
                    It looked like Java, but why was the 'M' capitalized in main? Why was the 'S' lower-case in string? That's not how we write our main() in java. Looking in to this anomoly, he discovered that he didn't need to wear glasses in order to C#.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Side tracked from his studies, the addictCoder read through hundreds of examples of C# scripts. "This is great, it's like I've been learning two langua--" that's when he saw it. UNITY3D GAME ENGINE featuring C# and the Boogie Bones. The "Boogie Bones" part was made up, but anyway, his journey took a turn down the road to C# and, you guessed it, programming video games. He obtained a Unity Pro license at the Unite event in Las Vegas. Programmed, many mobile games and small platformer games. All this, however, is another story. Let's fast forward to today.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Now that the addictCoder was all C#'d up, he turned around and saw an old friend. Java, as proud as ever. After a long talk and a few drinks, Java and the addictCoder rekindled their relationship. The addictCoder and Java now reside happily in a Java Coding Bootcamp deep in the uncharted lands of Denver, Colorado. The addictCoder plans on becoming and Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 8 Programmer in the next few months.
