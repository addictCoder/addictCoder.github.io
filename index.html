                    <p>If we go back in time, you were hypothetically creating a super awesome game. I had so generously helped you write your attack() method and you were very appreciative. You're welcome. Anyway, I wanted to talk about something that was in the attack() method that may not have made sense to you at the moment. I want to clear this up. Do you remember seeing (int)?</p>

                    <p>Let's assume you're making a game and in that game, you've created many weapons for the player to use. Each weapon 
                    has a minimum and maximum damage value. Lets say it's the "Holy Club of Stupidity" with a +5 to rock throwing skill(HCoS).
                    The HCoS has a minimum damage value of 5 and a maximum damage value of 20. How would we determine the amount of damage inflicted to an enemy character? Well, in case you didn't read the title of this post, Math.random().</p>

                    <p>Have you ever built a super-sweet HotWheels&trade; track and wanted to give it a run for every car you have? Have you
                    ever played your favorite game at the arcade until you ran out of quarters? Have you ever attempted a new trick on your skateboard until you landed it? Well java has too! Well, sort of. With Java, if we want an action to repeat itself a given number of times, we use loops.</p>

                    <p>You see it wit every script you write. That strange and mysterious keyword. Is it trying to send your method into a black hole? What is it's true purpose. Webster's dictionary states that it meant completely empty, but there is so much code that follows it. What does it mean!? Is this some kind of a sick joke? Who would do this to developers? They must be stopped before we all fall victim to their madness!! Why must we write VOID!?</p>

                    <p>Going through school, you've seen '=' a lot. Usually in  an algebra equation like, y = (5 + 4) &divide; 3. Luckily for us programmers, it hasn't changed! The '=' is an assignment operator. If we took that algebra equation and put it into our script, we would write <strong>int y = (5 + 4) / 3;</strong> or because we're smart and we can do that equation in our head, we would write <strong>int y = 3;</strong>. What the '=' operator tells the compiler is "this variable is equal to this value."</p>
